# Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string
# that contains the original value of the argument with the first character of
# every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

# You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

# algorithm:
# split string into words
# capitalize each word
# join the words together

def word_cap(str)
  str.split(' ').map(&:capitalize).join(' ')
end

p word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
p word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
p word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'
